# Life of Rick
Rick's life began on the green planet of Kashyyyk, where he lived a relatively peaceful life. Kashyyyk is basically a forest with the locals living in extensive treehouse cities. 
## The Beginning of a Rebellion
Rick left his home in Kashyyyk to join the Rebel Alliance. Most wookies didn't get involved in the affairs of the galaxy, but Rick felt that to protect the forest he would have to fight the Imperial Order.
