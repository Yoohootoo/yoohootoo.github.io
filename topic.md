## Learn the three exposure settings
Each exposure setting will raise or lower the amount of light hitting the sensor while adjusting a secondary effect. They are as follows:
1. Shutter speed - A faster shutter speed decreases blur while decreasing light entering the camera
2. Aperture - The aperture is the hole that changes width to allow more or less light in. A wider aperture decreases the area in focus.
3. ISO - The ISO is the sensor's sensitivity to light. A higher ISO will brighten an image, but will get graininer the higher it goes.
